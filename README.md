Security Tool - Digital Forensics Module
Overview
This tool includes a Digital Forensics module designed to assist investigators in analyzing storage media while ensuring the integrity of the original data. When conducting digital forensic investigations, it is imperative to follow best practices to prevent unintentional modifications to the evidence.

Reminder
Always use a forensic write blocker when accessing storage media containing potential evidence. Failure to do so may result in unintended changes to the evidence.

How to Use the Forensic Write Blocker
Whether you are working with hardware or software-based solutions, the following steps are essential:

Select the Right Tool:
Choose a forensic write blocker that is appropriate for the type of storage media you are investigating (e.g., SATA, USB, IDE).

Check Compatibility:
Ensure that the write blocker is compatible with the storage device you intend to analyze.

Verify Write Protection:
Before proceeding with any forensic examination, confirm that the write protection feature is active. This ensures that no unintentional changes are made to the evidence.

Document the Process:
Maintain detailed records of the write-blocking process, including the make and model of the write blocker used.
